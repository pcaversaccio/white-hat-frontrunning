# White Hat Frontrunning

White hat frontrunning [script](./go.sh) to outpace hackers and secure funds from compromised wallets. The (Bash) script is intentionally designed with minimal dependencies, requiring only the native tools provided by Linux and [`cast`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/cast) from [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that `cast` are installed locally. For installation instructions, refer to this [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

First, modify the main loop in the [script](./go.sh). At present, it's set to send gas to a victim wallet and transfer a specific token. Since the main loop needs to be tailored for each rescue, please review and adjust it carefully.

Next, make the script executable:

```console
chmod +x go.sh
```

Now it's time to configure the `.env` accordingly (this is an illustrative `.env` file):

> [!TIP]
> When submitting bundles to Flashbots, they are signed with your `FLASHBOTS_SIGNATURE_PK` key, enabling Flashbots to verify your identity and track your [reputation](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/reputation) over time. This reputation system is designed to safeguard the infrastructure from threats such as DDoS attacks. It's important to note that this key **does not** handle any funds and is **not** required to be the primary Ethereum key used for transaction authentication. Its sole purpose is to establish your identity with Flashbots. You can use any ECDSA `secp256k1` key for this, and if you need to create a new one, you can use [`cast wallet new`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet-new).

Finally, execute the script:

```console
./go.sh
```
